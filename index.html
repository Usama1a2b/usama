	<h1>Git Add</h1>
	<p>The git add command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area. It tells Git that you want to include updates to a particular file in the next commit. However, git add doesn't really affect the repository in any significant wayâ€”changes are not actually recorded until you run git commit .</p><img src="D:\assignment screen shots\gitAdd.png">

	<h1>Git Commit</h1>
	<p>The "commit" command is used to save your changes to the local repository. ... Using the "git commit" command only saves a new commit object in the local Git repository.</p><img src="D:\assignment screen shots\gitCommit.png">

	<h1>Git Status</h1>
	<p>The git status command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It lets you see which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. Status output does not show you any information regarding the committed project history.</p><img src="D:\assignment screen shots\gitStatus1.png">
